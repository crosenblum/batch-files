batch-files
===========

These are some of the batch files I use in windows to automate/maintain do tasks on my pc.

I am a long time Windows XP SP3 user, and as such, I believe in keeping my pc, running smooth, well maintainedd.

But to do so requires a lot of automation and batch file ussage.

I personally never liked Windows Task Scheduler, so I usually use this awesome shareware called System Scheduler.

So these are the batch files I use with the System Scheduler, to run antivirus, anti-spyware, ccleaner, and other tasks to automate maintenaince.

Enjoy!
